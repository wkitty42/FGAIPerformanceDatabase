Flightgear AI craft performance database

This repo is for updating the FlightGear AI craft performance database. 
The license is GPL2 because that's what FlightGear is licensed as and 
the initial batch of data came from FG. newly added data comes from 
openly published sources or is derrived from existing craft 
specifications.
